Student at Ecole 42, I am passionate about science and technology, particularly data and artificial intelligence. I am currently undertaking a work-study placement as a Software Architecture Engineer, where I am applying my skills to design solutions for industries.
I am always on the lookout for knowledge and new opportunities, and I am motivated by continuous learning and exploring new horizons.
